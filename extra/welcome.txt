Welcome everybody to this experimental session.

Let me say that I am very happy to have you here as today's subject pool. 

We are going to play a very interesting experiment, about quality perception and evaluation. 

By the way, I think that you are also quite lucky because, contrary to most other experiments played in the lab, this one is also quite fun.

You will be drawing a series of paintings, and then decide which of them are good enough to be displayed in one of the three exhibitions available in this game.

In case of any problem, please remain seated, raise your hand and I will come to you to help you.

At the end game there will be a brief questionnaire to fill in, please take it also seriously.

When you have completed the questionnaire please stay seated, and wait for the other to finish it. When everybody is ready, you will be called one by and you will be paid.
